DESCRIPTION
    DBD::Amazon provides a DBI and SQL syntax abstraction for the Amazon(R)
    E-Commerce Services 4.0 API *aka* ECS. <http://www.amazon.com/gp/>.
    Using the REST interface, and a limited SQL dialect, it provides a
    DBI-friendly interface to ECS.

    Be advised that this is ALPHA release software and subject to change at
    the whim of the author(s).

  Prerequisites
    Perl 5.8.0

    DBI 1.42 minimum

    SQL::Statement 1.14

    SQL::Amazon 0.10 (included in this bundle)

    Clone 0.15

  Testing Considerations
    To run the test package, you'll need

    An Amazon ECS User ID
        An environment variable DBD_AMZN_USER must be set to an Amazon ECS
        user ID in order to connect and execute ECS requests. Registration
        at the Amazon Web Services site is required to acquire a user ID.

    An Internet Connection
        Obviously.

    Patience
        Some of these tests download large amounts of Amazon catalog data,
        which can take some time (esp. since a minimum 1 second delay
        between requests is required).

    Also, be prepared for possible intermittent 'Internal Error' reports;
    these are problems within the Amazon ECS system, not failures in
    DBD::Amazon itself.

  Installation
    For Unix:

    *gunzip/untar as usual, then*

        cd DBD-Amazon-0.10
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
            make test
        make install

    Note that you probably need root or administrator permissions to
    install. Refer to ExtUtils::MakeMaker for details on installing in your
    own local directories.

    For Windows:

    *Unzip with your favorite utility, e.g., WinZIP, then*

        cd DBD-Amazon-0.10
        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
            nmake test
        nmake install

  SQL Dialect
    DBD::Amazon supports a subset of standard SQL, and additional predicate
    functions for keyword searches. Review SQL::Amazon::Parser and
    SQL::Statement for syntax details.

    Use "table_info()" to retrieve the metadata for any of the defined
    tables/views.

    Currently, only the following tables are defined:

    Books
    Offers
    CustomerReviews
    EditorialReviews
    BrowseNodes
    ListManiaLists
    Merchants
    SimilarProducts
    SysSchema

  Driver-specific Attributes
    amzn_locale *(Connection attribute)*
        Sets the Amazon locale to use (i.e., the root ECS request URL).
        Valid values are 'us', 'uk', 'de', 'fr', 'jp', 'ca' *(Currently,
        only us is supported)*. Default is 'us'.

    amzn_affiliate_id *(Connection attribute)*
        An Amazon affiliate ID. Default none.

    amzn_strict *(Connection attribute)*
    amzn_rate_limit *(Connection attribute)*
        Minimum number of seconds allowed between requests. Default 1. May
        be fractional.

    amzn_max_pages *(Connection and statement attribute)*
        Maximum number of pages to return for each request. Default 20.

    amzn_resp_group *(Connection and statement attribute)*
        ECS Response Group to use; can be any of 'Small', 'Medium', or
        'Large'; default is 'Large'.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Many thanks to Jeff Zucker for his guidance/patience, and adding some
    nice new features to SQL::Statement to help make DBD::Amazon a reality.
